# metaverse-chainlab-v5

## 0. Purpose

This skill governs V5 work for MBE: Real Experiment Platform.

V5 builds a metaverse blockchain research platform where method design, saved templates, experiment specs, compatibility validation, simulation, real local multi-process multi-shard execution, unified results, and paper artifacts share one truthful workflow.

V5 is not implemented just because this skill exists.

## 1. Mandatory Start Rule

Every V5 work round must start with:

```powershell
cd F:\Metaverse_Blockchain_Env
git status --short
git log -1 --oneline
```

If the worktree is dirty, stop and report unless the user explicitly says the existing changes are expected and authorizes continuing.

Every V5 work round must read:

- `README.md`
- `.agents/skills/metaverse-chainlab-v5/SKILL.md`
- the relevant V5 stage document
- the relevant current code and docs before changing files

Planning comes before implementation. For a new stage, update docs/skill before code.

## 2. Current Code Boundary

Current implemented baseline:

- V3 formal MetaTrack benchmark runner is a runnable local modular emulator / logical-runtime path.
- V4.3 realism smoke has signed tx, sender/public-key binding, per-node mempool, localhost TCP, PBFT-style messages, deterministic execution, persistence, state-root consistency, cross-shard evidence, fault delay/drop evidence, and BlockEmulator CSV bridge.
- Current V4.3 smoke primarily creates multiple runtime objects inside one Go supervisor process. It is not final one-node-one-OS-process real cluster.
- `mbe-node --run-mode server` exists.
- `mbe-supervisor` can generate plans and run V4.2/V4.3 smoke, but is not yet a full cluster orchestrator.
- Run Experiment executes mainly `quick_validation` and `v4_realism_validation`; main/comparison/ablation/workload-sensitivity/topology-scaling are preview-only.
- Saved templates must continue to reuse `V3SavedConfig`.

## 3. Only Two V5 Stages

V5 has only:

1. `V5.1 Real Plugin-Driven Multi-Process Multi-Shard Runtime`
2. `V5.2 Real Formal Experiment and Result Closure`

Do not create public V5.1.1, V5.1.2, V5.2.1, or similar outward stages.

Former planned `V4.3.6.2 Formal Runner Dispatch` and `V4.3.6.3 Result Center Integration` belong inside V5.2.

## 4. V5.1 Goal

V5.1 builds a unified `ExperimentSpec` driven runtime with:

- full-module plugin catalog;
- dynamic frontend catalog/schema configuration;
- backend compatibility engine and compiler;
- immutable `CompiledRunPlan`;
- real local multi-process supervisor;
- Go Interface + Factory Registry runtime plugins;
- continuous multi-shard block/consensus/execution/commit;
- cross-shard protocol inside the same runtime;
- real workload client submission;
- evidence-grade process/network/state/artifact acceptance.

V5.1 implementation status: complete as a local research runtime after the required 8-node, 16-node, four-method difference, backend/Go/frontend, and E2E gates pass. This does not close V5.2 and does not alter the production-security non-claims.

## 5. V5.2 Goal

V5.2 uses V5.1 to execute full formal experiment matrices and close:

- Preview / Simulation / Real Cluster modes;
- main, comparison, ablation, sensitivity, scaling, fault/recovery experiments;
- persistent run groups and child runs;
- unified run registry and result center;
- plugin metrics display;
- aggregation, confidence intervals, paper table/figure data;
- reproducibility ZIP;
- Paper Candidate gate.

## 6. Plugin Principle

All modules use one extension model. Categories:

- workload
- transaction_admission
- txpool
- sharding
- routing
- block_producer
- consensus
- network
- execution
- scheduler
- state_access
- state_storage
- cross_shard
- commit
- fault_injection
- metrics
- observability

Every plugin manifest must include `plugin_id`, `category`, `version`, `display_name`, `description`, `implementation_status`, `supported_backends`, `config_schema`, `default_config`, `capabilities`, `requirements`, `conflicts`, `metrics`, `runtime_factory` or `runtime_adapter`, and `truth_boundary`.

Adding a plugin should mean implementing an interface, registering a factory, adding a manifest, and adding tests. It should not require rewriting core frontend pages, supervisor flow, ExperimentSpec structure, compiler flow, or result-center core logic.

## 7. Frontend Rule

Frontend plugin configuration must follow:

```text
Plugin Catalog API
-> Generic Plugin Category Panel
-> Generic Plugin Selector
-> Generic Schema Form Renderer
-> Compatibility Feedback
-> Saved Template / ExperimentSpec
```

Avoid large `if (pluginId === "...")` branches in core pages. UI extensions are optional enhancements; generic schema form support is mandatory.

The UI must show implementation status, backend support, parameter ranges, dependencies, conflicts, truth boundary, and metrics. Formal Real Cluster requires all selected plugins to support `real_cluster`.

## 8. Backend Rule

Use layered services:

- Plugin Manifest Store
- Plugin Catalog Service
- Compatibility Engine
- ExperimentSpec
- Experiment Compiler
- Cluster Orchestrator
- Runtime Adapter / Factory Registry

The orchestrator handles process lifecycle only. It must not embed MetaTrack/PBFT/hash-routing behavior through plugin-name `if/else` logic.

Reuse `V3SavedConfig`, existing Composer Drafts, and existing method templates. Do not create a parallel template store.

## 9. Go Runtime Rule

Windows is primary. Do not plan Go `.so` dynamic plugins.

Use:

```text
Interface + Factory Registry + Plugin Manifest + Runtime Configuration
```

Target interfaces include:

- `WorkloadPlugin`
- `AdmissionPlugin`
- `TxPoolPlugin`
- `ShardingPlugin`
- `RoutingPlugin`
- `BlockProducerPlugin`
- `ConsensusPlugin`
- `NetworkPlugin`
- `ExecutionPlugin`
- `SchedulerPlugin`
- `StateAccessPlugin`
- `StateStoragePlugin`
- `CrossShardPlugin`
- `CommitPlugin`
- `FaultPlugin`
- `MetricsPlugin`
- `ObservabilityPlugin`

Startup:

```text
node_config
-> plugin profile
-> registry lookup
-> factory instantiate
-> parameter validation
-> dependency injection
-> runtime start
```

## 10. Execution Backends

Preview:

- configuration, compatibility, matrix, resource estimate only.

Simulation:

- V3 logical runtime;
- fast screening and debugging;
- not automatic paper evidence.

Real Cluster:

- V5.1 real multi-process runtime;
- required for formal Paper Candidate;
- no automatic fallback to simulation or V4 smoke.

## 11. Real Cluster Requirements

Formal `real_cluster` requires one logical node per independent OS process, with independent PID, TCP port, mempool, consensus state, data directory, state/block/receipt/tx-index, and logs.

Supervisor responsibilities:

- resource estimate;
- port allocation;
- node config compilation;
- start N `mbe-node` child processes;
- process manifest and PID recording;
- health/network/committee readiness checks;
- start real `mbe-client`;
- monitoring;
- fault policy;
- termination;
- graceful stop;
- forced reap;
- orphan check;
- artifact collection and validation.

Startup failure must fail the run. Do not fall back.

## 12. Continuous Multi-Shard Requirement

V5.1 must run all shards continuously:

- each shard has committee, leader, validators, mempool, consensus rounds, block height, and state root;
- multiple shards run at the same time;
- intra-shard and cross-shard transactions coexist in one runtime.

Cross-shard path:

```text
SourceLock
-> RelayCertificate
-> TargetVerify
-> TargetCommit
-> SourceFinalize
```

Failure path:

```text
Timeout
-> Refund / Abort
```

Certificates and cross-shard state messages must travel through the real node network and shard consensus/commit paths.

## 13. Truth Labels

Use:

```text
v3_final_light_runtime_baseline
v3_formal_simulation_logical_runtime
v4_realism_smoke_regression
v5_preview_only
v5_simulation_logical_runtime
v5_real_cluster_candidate
v5_paper_candidate_real_cluster
```

Do not claim V5 real_cluster before independent process evidence exists. Do not claim current V4 smoke is independent OS multi-process. Do not claim V3 formal is V5 real cluster.

## 14. Validation Rules

Docs/config-only:

```powershell
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Python/backend modified:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = (Get-Location).Path
python -m pytest tests -q
python -m pytest backend/tests -q
python scripts/v0_sanity.py
```

Frontend modified:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm.cmd run build
cd ..
```

Go modified:

```powershell
cd executor
go test ./...
cd ..
```

Do not commit if validation cannot be completed.

## 15. Git Rules

Do not push unless the user explicitly asks.

Commit only when explicitly requested or when the current work round asks for a commit and validation passes. Do not commit generated artifacts, caches, local run outputs, frontend build output, or large traces.

Every V5 work round final report must include:

```text
